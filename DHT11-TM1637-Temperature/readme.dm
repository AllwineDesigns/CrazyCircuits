# Simple Temperature Displayed through a 7 Segment Display

This is a very simple set of code and libraries to use the DHT11 or DHT22 Temperature/ Humidity Sensor along with a TM1637 7 Segment Display.

This code allows the user to show Temperature in various measurement scales as well as humidity. It makes use of several Open Source libraries, including some from Adafruit.com.

This project was originally designed, coded, and presented by youtube author RobotJax.

Libraries:

TM1637 - Download from GitHub and Manually Install
DHT11 - Do a search for the Library through the Arduino IDE. You'll want the Adafruit version 1.23, NOT the newer 1.3.
