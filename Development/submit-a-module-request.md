# Submit a Module Request

Have an idea for a project but need a module we don't already have?

Want to suggest a new or better component? 

You can ask just for a component and leave the rest up to us, or you can get as detailed and specific as you want. For best results for your project, draw or otherwise mock up the size, shape, and exact signals you need coming out of which holes. 

We can't guarantee we'll put the module in an educational kit, but we always release all the manufacturing files you'll need to make the module yourself through a service like [OSH Park](http://oshpark.com) or [MacroFab](http://macrofab.com). 

Send us an email at help@browndoggadgets.com with as much info as you can, and we'll do the rest!

## Questions

- Do you have a name or website we can link to when we release the module? 
- What's the best way to contact you, if not the email you send this from?
- Do you have a name you want for this module? 
- Does it matter where the signals come or go from the holes? 
- Do you want a particular layout -- 4x5? 2x3? 12x1028? 
- Do you have a project in mind? Tell us about it!
- Anything else we need to know?
