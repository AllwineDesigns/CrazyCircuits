Brick Servo Adaptors

These files adapt 9G sized servos to be used with any brick based system.  For example, you could use these to adapt a servo for use with a LEGO Technic tank.

There are several different Servo Horns depending on what you're using them for.

You may need to resize the center hole slightly to fit different 9G sized Servos.
