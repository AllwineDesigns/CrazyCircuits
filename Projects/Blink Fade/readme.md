# Blink/ Fade
This is the code that runs on our Blink/ Fade Board.  Above you'll find several diagrams for different mini projects, such as our LEGO Ambulance.

The code runs on the Attiny85 built into the board.

The program constantly runs and makes each pin do a different function.  

- Pin 0: Fades in and out
- Pin 1: Fades in and out
- Pin 2: Slow Blink 
- Pin 3: Blinks on and off
- Pin 4: Blinks off and on (alternates with Pin 3)

If you're programing this code into an 85, set the clock to "8Mhz (internal)."
