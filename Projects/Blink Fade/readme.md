# Blink/ Fade
This is the code that runs on our Blink/ Fade Board.

The code runs on the Attiny85 built into the board.

The program constantly runs and makes each pin do a different function.  

- Pin 0: fades in and out
- Pin 1: heartbeat
- Pin 2: twinkles randomly
- Pin 3: blinks on and off
- Pin 4: blinks off and on (alternates with Pin 3)

If you're programing this code into an 85, set the clock to "8Mhz (internal)."
