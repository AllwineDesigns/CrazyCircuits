# Cylon Pumpkin

This fun project uses 4 LEDs and either the Crazy Circuits Robotics or Touch Boards to make a simple Larson Scanner. Build this into a real pumpkin or use our LEGO guide to make a plastic one.

In the above files you'll find a simple wiring diagram, a LEGO build template, and code.
