# Dual Axis Rocket Launcher

This fun project uses three servos and some LEGOs to create simple rocket launcher.  To control them all we're using a Joystick module and a pushbutton.  The Joystick controls the X and Y servos, and the pushbutton activates the "launch" servo. We've chosed to use the Robotics Board so that we can easily plug in our Servos and Joystick. If you're using a Touch Board you'll need to use some Male or Right Angle Header parts in order to plug in the servos and Joystick.  (Really the Robotics Board is the way to go with this. The only reason you'd want to do the Touch Board is if you wanted to create a capacitive touch Touch Point.)

Our design uses four LEGO spring loaded missle launchers (from a LEGO X-Wing set) as well as a variety of LEGO Technic parts. Our design is probably a bit complicated, LEGO wise, as we're using a similar body design to our Time Lapse Camera project. Turning this into a single axis project would require no changes to the code.

The one area you should follow is the "Launch" Servo since our code is set up for that.  We modified a design found on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX9ioTXpLmk) for our launcher.
