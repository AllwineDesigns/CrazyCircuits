# Game of Simon

*** In Progress, Guide Not Complete ***

This project is designed to create a replication of the classic electronics game Simon.  It uses 4 LED, four buttons, a piezo speaker, and either our Touch Board or Robotics Board.  Due to the fact that either board works well for this project we've provided several sets of code and wiring diagrams to follow.  Make sure that you're using the correct set of code and diagram for the board you're using.  (The code is identical, we just change which pins do what since the pin/hole layout is different between the two baords.)

There is also a third version of the code that we're working on as well.  This version uses the built in Capacitive Touch abilities of the Touch Board in order to use different inputs instead of buttons.  Our two prefered inputs are Squishy Circuits conductive dough and Bare Conductive Paint.  This code WILL NOT work with the Robotics Board.
