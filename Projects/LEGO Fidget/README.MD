# 3D Printed LEGO Fidget Spinner

In this project we're going to use a 3D Printer to create our own custom fidget spinner, then attach Crazy Circuits parts to make it light up. We've provided several different variations to print with, changing the number of arms and the number of LEGO studs on them. There are also some additional files for adding in M8 sized Nuts as weights.

Obviously you're going to need access to a 3D printer, btu if you don't one readily available you can always use online services such as Shapeways to make one for you.  We used our office Makerbot Replicator 2 for printing, with a print time of around 45 minutes for a three armed spinner. If the studs are too big or too small you'll have to change the size and try again, same goes for the bearing.

Like all good fidget spinners ours requires a 608 bearing, also known as a Skate Bearing. There are many varieties available on Amazon. For a bearing cover you can choose from a wide variety of available 3D models on Thingiverse.  We used files from this spinner, but had to reduce the size a couple percentage points.
