# Larson Scanner Code - Attiny85

This code runs a simple Larson Scanner sketch for 4 LEDs.

The code has several modes that can be cycled through by wiring in a momentary push button.

We put this project together for use as a demo using Circuit Scribe conductive ink and some custom rare Earth magnets.

This project would work just fine using conductive ink, thread, or tape.  

Use a 3V power supply, such as 2 AA or 2 AAA battery holders. You can use a CR2032 battery, but the amperage output might not be enough.

Use a regular Arduino to program an 85.
