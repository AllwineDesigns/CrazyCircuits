# Larson Scanner Code - Touch Board, Robotics Board, and Blink/Fade Board (Tiny85)

This code runs a simple Larson Scanner sketch for 4 LEDs. The code has several modes that can be cycled through by wiring in a momentary push button.  We used this code to make a Cylon Pumpkin for Halloween.  It's also suitable for making your car look like Kit from Knight Rider.

We have three different versions of the code.  Use the version that goes with your board.  If you're using a standard off the shelf Arduino you should use the Robotics Board code.  Diagrams for each type of board can be found in the files above.

If you're trying to reporgram the Blink/Fade Board you'll need to follow our Reprograming the Blink/ Fade Board guide.  It's not tough to do, but it requires a bit of reading and work.
