<p>One Channel Music Visualizer</p>

This project is a simple music visualizer for Arduino.  We're using Crazy Circuits parts since they're LEGO compatible.

To build this you'll need the following supplies.  A Crazy Circuits Arudino Board or a Crazy Circuits Touch Board, an audio in module, a variable resistor module, up to 15 LEDs, an audio splitter, and a music source.
