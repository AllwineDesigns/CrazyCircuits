# One Channel Music Visualizer

This project is a simple music visualizer for Arduino.  We're using Crazy Circuits parts since they're LEGO compatible.

To build this you'll need the following supplies.  A Crazy Circuits Arudino Board or a Crazy Circuits Touch Board, an audio in module, a variable resistor module, up to 15 LEDs, an audio splitter, and a music source.

This is not a true "equalizer."  All the program is doing is looking at the volume of sound coming in. The variable resistor acts as a volume control for the system.  If the volume level gets too high all the LEDs get stuck in the ON position and you'll have to hit the reset button on your board.

You can change the code to add more or less LEDs into the mix.

Eventually we plan on modifying the code in order to do two channel audio.
