# NASA T-Shirt

Make several LEDs twinkle when a touch point is activited.

## Overview

We wanted to make a NASA t-shrt more interesting, so we added LEDs that are controlled by a touch point.

To accomplish this we used a Crazy Circuits Touch Board, Conductive Thread, a 3 AAA Battery Holder, four White LEDs, and one Red LED.

The basic code is set up so that the Red LED is always fading in and out. This is because we added a Space Shuttle Patch onto the shirt and wanted to give it flames.

We covered the NASA lettering with a patch work of Conductive Thread then wired that to the Touch Board. When Touched, this causes the four White LEDs to turn on.  They're deisgned to Fade in and Out.
