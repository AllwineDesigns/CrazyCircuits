# NES Controller

In this project we're using a Crazy Touch board as a keyboard emulator in order to make a classic NES controller.  Here you'll find the Code, LEGO Digital Designer files, laser cut files, and general information.  We also have a handy youtube video of how to build this project.

Each version uses Crazy Circuits parts.  The Crazy Circuits Touch Board along with 6-8 momentary buttons.  For the Giant LEGO version we're using 12mm buttons, for the laser cut version we're using standard micro push buttons with extra tall plastic nubs.

We have two different versions of this project.  The most exciting version is the Giant LEGO NES Controller.  You'll need to download the free LEGO Digital Designer software as well as our design file to get the full list of LEGO parts.  We recommend using sites such as BrickOwl.com to aquire all the parts.  Be warned, it cost us around $130 in raw LEGO parts to build this project.

<p>The smaller version uses an 8x16 LEGO plate as a build platform.  This then goes into a laser cut wood enclosure.  You'll find a wiring diagram for that listed above.</p>

<p>The Touch Board is based off the Teensy LC development board.  It'll work with the regular Arudino software but you'll have to install some additional software to get the board and your computer to talk to each other.
