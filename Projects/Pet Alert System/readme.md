# Pet Alert System

This is a fun project designed to give several responses to a Touch input. A second Touch input resets everything.

The three outputs are as follows.

- LED Fades.
- Piezo Speaker plays.
- Servo moves.

In our version of this project we're using the Crazy Circuits Touch Board, Conductive Nylon Tape, and Bare Conductive Paint. The Touch Board has built in Capacitive Touch, which we then break out via the Conductive Tape, with the final Touch Point being the Bare Conductive Paint.

*Note, this would also work as a Child Alert system to keep them away from any cookie jar.
