# Pillow Dice (or Die if you want to be super correct)

This project uses a reprogramed Blink/ Fade Board and a whole lot of Conductive Thread to create a die pillow.  Seven LEDs show a random number, which is trigger by a pushbutton or tilt switch.

While not an insane project, it is a low of sewing and kind of difficult.  You can follow the same diagram and guide to make this project on a brick building plate using Conductive Tape.
