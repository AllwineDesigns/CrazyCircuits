# How to Reprogram a Bink/Fade Board (ATTiny85)

The Crazy Circuits Blink/Fade Board is a preprogramed board, however it uses an ATTiny85 which in fact can be reprogramed with a bit of work.

Warning: This isn't a super easy activity to do, but it isn't difficult either. This is not for beginners.

## Overview

To reprogram an ATTiny85 chip, like on the Blink/Fade Board, you only need another Arduino and a Capacitor. By keeping things in the Crazy Circuits wheelhouse we can build a reuseable jig that everything pops into. This makes programing groups of Blink/Fade Boards an easy task.

The parts you need to do this within the Crazy Circuits system are as follows: Robotics Board, a Blink/Fade Board, Female Header (or you could use a blink 2 pin board if you have one), a 10uF/ 25V Electrolytic Capacitor, Nylon Conductive Tape, and a LEGO Compatable building platform.

If you want to use a regular off the shelf Arduino for this, just use jumper cables and alligator clips to connect to the Blink/Fade Board.
