Scorekeeper

This is a simple program that tracks two sets of scores. The project uses a Crazy Circuits Touch Board, LEDs, a Piezo Speaker, and Conductive Tape.

Create two Touch input points.  Wire up 8 LEDs and Speaker.

With each Touch the number of LEDs increases up to 4. On the 4th Touch the Piezo Speaker sounds. A 5th Touch resets everything.

How Might You Use This?

To keep track of Scores up to 3.  If you're really worried about trying to win a "Best of 5" Rock, Paper, Scissors match.
