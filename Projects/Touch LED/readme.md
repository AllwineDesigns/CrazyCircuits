# Crazy Touch LED

This is a simple sketch that uses four Touch Points and 4 LED outputs.

Touch a Touch Point and one of the LEDs turns on.

We designed this to be used with conductive dough as a demo project, though any conductive material would work.  You could easily modify this code to do various effects.
