# Crazy Circuits Touch Piano/ Synth

Simple synth using the Capacitive Touch feature of the Crazy Circuits Touch Board.

This project requires a Crazy Circuits Touch Board, Bare Conductive Paint, and Conductive Nylon Tape.  However, you can use any conductive material and have the same effects.

The Crazy Touch Board uses a Teensy LC, and the code is written to make use of its features.  If you've not used a Teensy LC before you'll need to download some additional software in order to get the standard Arudino IDE to talk to it.
